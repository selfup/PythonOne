#### PythonOne

Repo for messing around with Object Oriented Python!

### Disclaimer

**If you want to run the ```complex.py``` file make sure you are in the ```Misc``` *directory*. I use ```rm -rf ruby_store.rb``` in that script so please be careful. Nothing can really go wrong, but just to be sure!**

The ```complex.py``` file will delete and create the ```ruby_store.rb``` file. Then it will run the ruby file. It pulls the terminal output form the ruby file to pass the output as an ARGV for the ```fib.py``` file. Essentially 3 files get run.

There is really no reason for this, it was just fun to mess around.

#### This repo is also being used to teach students how to learn Python!

Using Python2 for now

Got the testing down!

Bonus: Homebrew script for updating all of the things!

Edit: Removed all uses of interpy. Regular Python interpolation is now being used everywhere.
