#### PythonOne

Repo for messing around with Object Oriented Python!

### Disclaimer

**If you want to run the ```complex.py``` file make sure you are in the ```Misc``` *directory*. I use ```rm -rf ruby_store.rb``` in that script so please be careful. Nothing can really go wrong, but just to be sure!**

Using Python2 for now

Got the testing down!

Bonus: Homebrew script for updating all of the things!

Edit: Removed all uses of interpy. Regular Python interpolation is now being used everywhere.
