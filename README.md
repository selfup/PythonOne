#### PythonOne

Repo for messing around with Object Oriented Python!

Make sure to ```pip install interpy``` if you want to run all of the files. I used regular python2 interpolation but the ruby like interpolation is nice to help students learn python.

### Disclaimer

**If you want to run the complex.py file make sure you ```pip install interpy``` and make sure you are in the Misc directory. I use ```rm -rf ruby_store.rb``` in that script so please be careful. Nothing can really go wrong, but just to be sure!**

Using Python2 for now

Got the testing down!

Bonus: Homebrew script for updating all of the things!
